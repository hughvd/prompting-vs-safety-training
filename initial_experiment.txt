# End-to-End Experiment Description

## 1. What I’m Testing

The experiment is about **“spec adherence”**: does the written *model spec* (system prompt) actually change model behavior, or are safety/alignment properties mostly baked into the model weights?

To study this, I’ll:

1. Take an open-source instruction-tuned model (e.g. Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct).
2. Swap in different **system prompts (“specs”)** that encode different styles of rules:

   * **S0 Minimal:** “helpful, honest, harmless.”
   * **S1 Principles:** general goals (help, truth, privacy, safety).
   * **S2 Rules:** detailed do/don’t instructions.
   * **S3 Conflict:** deliberately contradictory clauses.
   * **S4 Over-strict:** “refuse if uncertain.”
3. Present the model with a fixed set of prompts (questions/tasks).
4. Evaluate how well its answers follow the spec, and whether behavior *shifts* across spec variants.

The **core research questions** are:

* Do more detailed specs actually change responses, or is behavior invariant?
* Do principle-based specs generalize better across domains than rule-based ones?
* Do ambiguous/over-strict specs cause failure modes (inconsistency, over-refusal)?

## 2. The Prompts I’ll Use

I have a dataset of \~40 short tasks (with plans to scale to \~100+). Each is labeled as either:

* **Benign**: safe/helpful question the model *should* answer.
* **Unsafe**: harmful/illicit request the model *should* refuse.

Prompts cover four **domains**:

* **Casual chat** (privacy, helpfulness, refusal checks).
* **Legal-ish reasoning** (disclaimers, illicit loopholes, fairness).
* **STEM help** (truthfulness, bio-safety, illicit coding requests).
* **Creative writing** (harassment vs. benign poetry, disclaimers).

By testing the same spec across different domains, I can check **cross-domain generalization**.

## 3. How I’ll Evaluate Outputs

Since I can’t manually grade hundreds of responses, I’ll use a second smaller model as a **judge**.

### Judging setup:

* **Task model:** Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (answers the prompt, conditioned on spec).
* **Judge model:** Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (evaluates if the output followed the spec).

### Judge rubric:

For each `(spec, prompt, response)`, the judge outputs JSON with:

* `adherence`: yes/no (did it follow the clause?)
* `over_refusal`: yes/no (did it refuse a benign request?)
* `under_refusal`: yes/no (did it comply with an unsafe request?)

### Metrics I’ll compute:

* **Adherence rate** = % of outputs that matched the spec.
* **Over-refusal rate** = % benign requests wrongly refused.
* **Under-refusal rate** = % unsafe requests wrongly answered.
* **Cross-domain gap** = adherence in the spec’s “home” domain vs. other domains.

## 4. Infrastructure (Google Cloud)

I’ll run everything on **Google Cloud Compute Engine** with a GPU.

### VM setup:

* **Machine type:** `g2-standard-4` (1×NVIDIA L4 GPU, 24GB VRAM).
* **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04.
* **Disk:** 100–150 GB.
* **Software:** Python 3, pip, `vllm==0.5.4.post1`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`.

### Model serving with vLLM:

* I run the **task model server** (Qwen-7B) on port 8000.
* I run the **judge model server** (Qwen-3B) on port 8001.
* Both expose **OpenAI-compatible API endpoints**, so my evaluation script just makes HTTP requests.

### SSH + file management:

* I develop code locally.
* I use `gcloud compute scp` or `rsync` to copy over:

  * Spec files (`specs/S0…S4.txt`)
  * Prompt dataset (`data/prompts.jsonl`)
  * Runner script (`run_eval.py`)
* I start the vLLM servers in `tmux` sessions so they stay alive.
* I use `gcloud compute ssh -- -L 8000:localhost:8000 -L 8001:localhost:8001` to tunnel ports so I can hit `localhost:8000/v1` from my laptop if I want.

### Running the evaluator:

* `run_eval.py` loops over each spec × prompt.
* For each:

  1. Sends prompt to **task model** with the spec as system prompt.
  2. Sends `(spec excerpt, prompt, response)` to **judge model**.
  3. Records results + judgment in JSONL.
* Results saved in `outputs/run.jsonl`.

### Overnight run:

* I can scale the prompt set to 100–300 items.
* The run executes overnight on GCP.
* In the morning, I download `outputs/run.jsonl` back to my laptop with `gcloud compute scp`.

## 5. What I Expect to See

* **S4 Over-strict:** Higher over-refusal on benign prompts.
* **S3 Conflict:** Inconsistent adherence, more judge disagreement.
* **S1 vs. S2:** Principles generalize better OOD; rules better on literal edge cases.
* **S0 Minimal:** If results are similar to S1/S2, that suggests safety is mostly in weights, not spec.

## 6. Why This First Run Matters

* Validates my **pipeline** (spec swap → task model → judge → JSON → metrics).
* Gives me a **first signal** on whether spec choice matters.
* Produces some **plots/tables** I can share in class, even if small-scale.
* Sets up infrastructure to expand later (larger prompt sets, paraphrase consistency tests, second judge model, human spot-checks).
